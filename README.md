# QGIS-Scripts
A repo of python scripts and style files I use when making maps in QGIS.

# Usage
I believe you can use these outside of the QGIS terminal, you just need to import the proper library.

BBox should be ready to go for any one.

The other two scripts are specialized to my uses, hopefully someone finds them helpful

# Style
The style sheets help visualize the csv data I typically use.
